# e-Finder: a tool to find multigene elements in assembled sequences using profile HMMs.

e-Finder is a generic tool for detection and extraction of multigene elements from assembled genomes using profile HMMs. e-Finder executes hmmsearch program (HMMER package) to run similarity searches using profile as queries against translated sequences of the assembled genomes. Any region containing a cluster of genes can be detected, such as transposons, CRISPR-Cas systems, prophages, operons, etc.
